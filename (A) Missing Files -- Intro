# Atlanta_crime

  This is an project to analysis how crimes affects Atlanta and its neighboring cities. Unfortunally, I can only upload what Github allows me to upload. 
This project is mainly done with ArcGIS (and because the file is bigger then 25 mb) I can't upload the project files itself. 
And no, this is an .mpkx file so I can't code the files into here (since I can't connect it in the first place).

  So the files I've uploaded are the interperation, maps, stats, and the dataset I've created from ArcGIS. 
The .docx mainly consist of maps since the main point of the project is to - clean, analysis, manipulate the data and create maps to analysis how crimes affects Atlanta and its neghboring cities
(need heat map, population density, geographic info, demographics, etc.).

But anyways, if you require the project file itself, I would be more then happy to email it to you - email: dz115471@gmail.com 
(please remeber to include that you came from github, else, I might ignore you)
